"""
This module provides a set of permission lock functions for use
with Evennia's permissions system.

To call these locks, make sure this module is included in the
settings tuple `PERMISSION_FUNC_MODULES` then define a lock on the form
'<access_type>:func(args)' and add it to the object's lockhandler.
Run the `access()` method of the handler to execute the lock check.

Note that `accessing_obj` and `accessed_obj` can be any object type
with a lock variable/field, so be careful to not expect
a certain object type.


**Appendix: MUX locks**

Below is a list nicked from the MUX help file on the locks available
in standard MUX. Most of these are not relevant to core Evennia since
locks in Evennia are considerably more flexible and can be implemented
on an individual command/typeclass basis rather than as globally
available like the MUX ones. So many of these are not available in
basic Evennia, but could all be implemented easily if needed for the
individual game.
